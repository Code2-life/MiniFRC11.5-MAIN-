BLUE SIDE                                                                   RED SIDE

the version that looking down to the other team, and youre on the left is called "left"
the other, is called right

you start on the middle, facing inwards to YOUR side. 


start at {0, 0}, yaw 0
go to {46, 0}, translation {46, 0}      , dist: 46; 
go to {62, 10}, translation {16, 10}    , dist: 19; yaw: 32     , transform: 32
go to {62, -8}, translation {0, -18}    , dist: 18; yaw: 122    , transform: 90
go to {41, 5}, translation {-20, 13}    , dist: 25; yaw: 243    , transform: 121

since all transforms are < 180, i can use abs rotate
